# Static site generator

This guided project from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) made me code a tool that converts raw markdown pages with static resources (images, css) into fully fledged html websites. 

Similar in concept to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), yet much less powerful and sophisticated.
